This is my first submission for the /r/retrobattlestations 2018 BASIC Month competition.  The current version is a direct port of Cannonball for the Tandy/TRS-80 Color Computer.  I hope to convert it to use actual graphics as well as port it to a few other Tandy/TRS-80 platforms before the contest ends.
